## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Web Interface

**Problem:** Browser can't reach http://192.168.4.1

**Solutions:**
- Check serial monitor - is device showing "READY"?
- Verify you're connected to `SmartKraft-To2Do` WiFi
- Try http://to2do.local instead
- Restart the ESP32 (unplug and replug USB)

### ESP32 Not Uploading

**Problem:** Upload fails or port not found

**Solutions:**
- Install ESP32 drivers (CP2102 or CH340, depending on your board)
- Try a different USB cable (some are power-only)
- Press and hold BOOT button while uploading
- Check board settings: ESP32 Dev Module, 115200 baud, 4MB flash

### Email Not Sending

**Problem:** SMTP notifications don't work

**Solutions:**
- For Gmail: Use App Password, NOT your regular password
- Verify SMTP server and port are correct
- Check ESP32 has internet access (not in AP-only mode)
- Enable "Less secure app access" if using older email providers

### Data Not Saving

**Problem:** Changes lost after restart

**Solutions:**
- Check serial monitor for SPIFFS errors
- Try factory reset: Settings â†’ Backup â†’ FACTORY RESET
- Re-upload the sketch with "Erase All Flash" option

## Serial Monitor Output

The serial monitor (115200 baud) shows useful information:

```
